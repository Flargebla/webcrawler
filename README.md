##What is the goal of this project?
We want to build our own webcrawler that can successfully navigate through websites and recover the desired information

##Where can I get more information about webcrawlers?
Glad you asked. Wikipedia has information on webcrawlers [right here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler)

There is also more information [here as well](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/search-engine1.htm)

##What do you hope to accomplish?
We want to successfully create our own webcrawler. In the process we hope to understand more about how they work, and the skills and knowledge utilized and gained will certainly be a valuable reward, even if there are issues with the webcrawler

##Is there a roadmap of the project?
| Time Frame | Feature |
| ---------- | --------|
| As Soon as possible | Develop the basic framework of the crawler utilizing a java class |
| Some time after that | Develop the ability to store information in a text pad or even an excel document |
| Around the same time | Implement the ability to differentiate company names |
| Beyond | Webcrawler will be able to search for individual items on a page | 

##Any other questions?
Sure, send us any questions, comments, concerns, fan mail, etc.
